This is the code based used in our representation paper. Currently
we don't have a good documentation, but we are working on it, for now
please read:
http://adamilab.msu.edu/markov-network-brains/
and also visit the Evolution of Swarming Project here on github:

This repository contains two XCODE projects, one called representation
which allows you to evolve agents that either use Markov Brains or
ANNs to solve a task that requires representation.
The second XCODE project called "representation free topology ANN"
allows you to do the same, except that now instead of having
a fixed ANN topology, the topology can evolve with it.
